# IQA
Public code for image quality analysis projects

Tested on Matlab 2017a

Relies on https://www.github.com/DartmouthGrangerLab/MatlabCommon , which must also be in your matlab path.

This is the minimal set of code needed to run. Lab members should look to our private repository "Jpeg" (IQA folder) for a more complete code base (e.g. Dartmouth computing cluster scripts).
